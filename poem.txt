Though language may be useless, for
No words men write can stop the war
Or measure up to the relief
Of its immeasurable grief,
Yet truth, like love and sleep, resents
Approaches that are too intense
- W.H. Auden

"It is not possible to make a mistake."
- Kurt Vonnegut

Reject perfection.

The same difference.
